/**
 * Abstract class that handles some boiler plate initialization for mutation.
 *
 * Mutation rate should be between 0-1. But this is not checked.
 * A mutation less than 0 means that same as a 0% probability. And a mutation
 * rate greater than 1 means the same as 100% probability.
 *
 * A genotype will be mutated if random probability is less than mutation rate value.
 *
 * Here mutation rate applies to entire genotype, since this is for permutation. So this
 * is different than checking for mutation at the gene level that could be used in
 * bit representations.
 *
 * A mutation algorithm needs to be passed in. Ie. Swap, Scramble, or Inversion for this case.
